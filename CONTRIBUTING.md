## Style Guide

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types
- Export types/interfaces from `src/types`
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Memoize expensive computations

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use meaningful test descriptions

### Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Example:
```
Add hint animation feature

- Implement smooth animation when hint is used
- Add configuration for animation duration
- Update tests for new feature

Fixes #123
```
